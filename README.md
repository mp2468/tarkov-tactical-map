TODO/IDEAS:

1. custom context menu, pie chart with tool selection on left and color selection on right, can click on any of them to switch if you want to quickly change your tool/color. Also can make it so when cursor leaves the circle, select the tool from that quadrant.
2. Look up emoji library that is tarkov themed, add them here so we can add boss/scav/etc type of icons.
